# Sample Go Project

This is a sample Go project to help you get started.

[Documentation](http://golang.org/doc/)

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to the synced folder.
   In this case we sync to `GOPATH`, so the code can be found at
   `/home/vagrant/go/src/github.com/N4SJAMK/IIZP2010G0/`. Do some reading about
   Go and setting it up in general. The documentation is very good.

2. Run `go get` to install dependencies, they will be installed in a manner
   similar to how your project is laid out.

3. Run `go run [files]` to run the application!
