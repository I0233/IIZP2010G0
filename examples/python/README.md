# Sample Python Project

This is a sample Python project to serve as a starting point. Please do note
that the sample here does cut corners and go straight into business, leaving
very important (and mandatory!) stuff out.

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to the synced folder.

2. Create a virtual environment for yourself.
   ```
   virtualenv venv
   ```
   You should read up on what virtual environments mean and how do they work.

3. Activate your environment
   ```
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
   You should now see a `venv` prefix on your prompt.

4. Install the dependencies.
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Run your app.
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
